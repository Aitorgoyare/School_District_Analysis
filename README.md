# School District Analysis
## Overview of the school district analysis:

The school board has notified Maria and her supervisor that the students_complete.csv file shows evidence of academic dishonesty; specifically, reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders appear to have been altered. Although the school board does not know the full extent of the academic dishonesty, they want to uphold state-testing standards and have turned to Maria for help. She has asked you to replace the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact. Once youâ€™ve replaced the math and reading scores, Maria would like you to repeat the school district analysis that you did in this module and write up a report to describe how these changes affected the overall analysis.


## Results:

## Deliverable 1: Replace the reading and math scores.
### Replace the 9th grade reading and math scores at Thomas High School with NaN.

## Summary:
After replacing the scores of the 9th year students we found out that not very much has actually changed. Due to being a very small portion of the whole set.
